PRO TIP: The trick with poetry - and with multiple-choice quizzes (or exams!) - lies in trying to be as precise as possible. Just because poems can mean many things does not necessarily mean that they can mean ANYthing! The more precise you are in your discussion of a poem's mechanics and/or meaning, the likelier your interpretation will be sound.
